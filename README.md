# dnans.org Ansible Test Playground

dnans serves as my Ansible learning and evaluation environment. I'm exploring Ansible as a potential replacement for my current scripting setup on [snand.org](https://snand.org). 

**Disclaimer**:  
This repo is experimental and contains work-in-progress code. It's not intended for public use, but if you find anything here useful, feel free...

---

## Current Focus

- Setting up a basic Ansible project structure.
- Automating server configurations, including:
  - Installing essential packages (`sudo`, `docker`, `samba`, `nfs`).
  - Managing system services.
  - Setting up persistent mounts using UUIDs.
- Incrementally learning best practices for roles, playbooks, and variable management.

## Versioning

| Version   | Status        | Description                      |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| `v0.0.1`  | Pre-release   | Initial setup, basic configurations. |
| `v0.0.x`  | In Progress   | Iterative improvements and testing. |

## Notes

- Expect frequent changes as I experiment with different configurations and approaches.
- Future milestones include creating reusable roles, integrating more advanced tasks, and documenting lessons learned.

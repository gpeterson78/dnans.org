# dnans.org is the dev site and infrastructure for snand.org

# present state - completely broken, I'm mid-stream of a refactor of many things so this is currently a development branch  

dnans is gradyp's  dev environment. this is purely a place to learn and play. 

this was my Ansible playground but I'm putting that aside.  this is now just the ordinary dev/testing for snand.org.  it needs a full rebuild but for now I'm using it to test wordpress replacements.  someday I'll return to ansible.

disclaimer :
this repo is experimental and contains work-in-progress code. it's not intended for public use, but if you find anything here useful, feel free...

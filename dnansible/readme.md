# Ansible Development Playground

This folder was originally used as my Ansible development environment to set up and maintain a dev server. It contains various Ansible roles, playbooks, and configurations that were used to deploy and manage the server. However, I'm currently abandoning this project for now...

## What's Inside

This folder includes:
- **Ansible Roles**: Pre-configured roles for common tasks like web server setup, user creation, and system configuration.
- **Playbooks**: YAML files that define automation workflows for setting up the environment.
- **Inventory Files**: Configurations for Ansible inventory management.
- **Custom Modules**: Any custom Python modules I created for specific tasks.

## How to Use (but probably don't)

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run `ansible-playbook` commands from the directory where you want to apply the playbooks.
3. You might need to run these commands from within the inventory folder if you're using dynamic inventory.

## Note

Please be aware that some of the code in here may be outdated or not fully tested. If you decide to revisit this project, I highly recommend using Ansible's latest features and best practices as Ansible has evolved significantly since then.

## Abandoned Project

This project is now on hold, but feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or discuss anything related to Ansible or infrastructure automation in general!
